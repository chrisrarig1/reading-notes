# What is HTML??

- **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) This is the code we use to determine
the layout of our websites.

## Developing a website with HTML

1. Develop a Wireframe
    - A **Wireframe** is a rough sketch of the layout of your website usually consisting of three parts the Header, Body, and Footer.
    - This is where you retain feedback from whoever you are building the site for.
    - Consider these the blueprints of your site.

2. Develop your code
    - HTML is a markup language that uses elements that you use as tags to identify content or formatting.
    - HTML follows a similar flow format as a wireframe. Top to bottom.
    - There are two main components of the code. 1. The *Head*: This is where you contain all the stuff not visible on the page such as tab name and character declarations. 2. The *Body*: This is where all of the content you want the viewer to see is applied.
    - Don't be frustrated after you finish coding and look at your website. It is just the framing!! We will apply CSS to spruce it up!!
