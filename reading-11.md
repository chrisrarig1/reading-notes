1. SQL -> Relational Database
1. NoSQL -> Non-Relational Databse

2. SQL -> Table based
2. NoSQL -> Document based

3. SQL -> Predefined schema
3. NoSQL -> Dynamic schema

4. SQL -> Vertically scalable
4. NoSQL -> Horizontally scalable

5. SQL -> Uses SQL
5. NoSQL -> Uses UnQL

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

    - For the complex query intensive enviroments

2. Give a real world example.

    - MySql

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

    - Simplistic query environment

4. Give a real world example.

    - MongoDB

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

    - NoSQL

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

    - Depends on the direction of the scalability but mainly SQL DB are used.

## SQL vs NoSQL

1. What does SQL stand for?

    - Structured Query Language

2. What is a relational database?

    - A database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

6. How does it work?

    - It is a large DB that has a collection of documents that do not need to be relational

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

    - A large collection of document json files

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

    - MongoDB due to its schema flexability

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

    - There is a limit to your computing power due to the vertical scaling

## Things I want to know more about

- I am familiar with SQL syntax and I am curious about NoSQL syntax
