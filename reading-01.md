# Introduction to React and Components

## What is a Component?

- It is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
- It is an object that is intended to interact with its peers

### Object Views

1. Object-oriented view
2. Conventional view
3. Process-related view

## Characteristics of a Component?

- *Reusability*- can be reused
- *Replaceable*- can be substituted with other components of the same nature
- *Not context specific*- able to operate in different environments and contexts.
- *Extensible*- can be extended from existing components to provide a new behavior
- *Encapsulated*- depicts the interface and allows the caller to use its functionality while not showing internal state.
- *Independent*- Minimal dependencies

## Advantages of Component Based Architecture

1. *Ease of Deployment*
2. *Reduced Cost*
3. *Ease of Development*
4. *Reusable*
5. *System Maintenance and Evolution*
6. *Independent*

## What is Props Short for and How is it Used?

- **Props** is short for properties and is used for passing data from one component to another.

### What is its Flow?

- Props have **uni-directional flow** meaning it is one way from parent component to the child component.
- They are intended to be read only
