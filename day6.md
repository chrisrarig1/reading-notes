# Learning JavaScript

- *JavaScript*: This code allows your website to become interactive.
It basically dictates how your site behaves.

## My Experince

- This was a true test in my coding ability. The lab concepts were similar to what i have experinced in SQL
- This coding language allows you to mash up your formatting in HTMl into exactly what you want through interactive behavior.
- In our lab we used coding through a conditional statement to create a prompt action and reaction through our website.

`if(time < 12){`
    `timeOfDay = 'Good Morning!!!';`
`} else if(time < 17){`
    `timeOfDay = 'Good Afternoon!!'; } `

- In the code above we used an *IF* statement to create a reaction to a prompt that the user answered. This reaction generated certain content based of the responses.

# How A Computer Works

## What Makes a Computer

- In this video I actually learned for the first time what a computer truly does:
    - Takes Input
    - Stores Information
    - Processes Information
    - Outputs Information

- The computer has computer has come along way from being as big as a whole room to only being a giant calculator.

## Binary Code

- During this video I actually learned the true defintion of binary code. Not only is it ones and zeros, but it using the table you can convert these numbers into larger numbers, letters, sounds,and colors.
- Through multiple electrical pathways and decision nodes the computer process constant on/off elecrical signals to generate the content we see everyday
