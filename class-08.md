# CSS/HTML Layout

## Grouping and Positioning

- `<div>` - These tags are used to group items to a certain section of the page

- **Positioning Schemes** allow you to control the flow and position of your content on the web page. There are five main **Positioning Schemes**

  - **Normal Flow**: Each block element generates a new line and the content flows done vertically.
  - **Relative**: This shifts content in a different direction away from its normal flow position while not affecting the other content.
  - **Absolute**: This positions the content in relation to the content inside of it.
  - **Fixed**: This decides the position of the content or element based on the browser window.
  - **Floating**: This allows the element to flow around the surrounding content.

## Page Sizes

- **Fixed Width**: Does not allow for adjustments to size with minimizing and maximizing the browser.
- **Liquid Layouts**: Fits the size of the browser as user re-adjusts the size of the web browser.

## CSS Frameworks

- **Grids**: You can use **CSS Framework** to create grids which can make organizing your page easier.
- They allow you to bypass writing repeated code, but require the use of class name in **HTML**
