# Learning Functions!!!

- *Functions* are statements that perform assigned tasks or generate values. I like to think of it as defining and using a function in math:

`F(x)= x^3+1`
`where x=3`
`F(3)= 28`

## What makes up a function

- A *Function* is made up of four parts:
    1. The name of the function
    2. The parameters of the function
    3. The JavaScript that the function performs
    4. The return
- Here is an example from my code:

`function getname(){`
    `let name = prompt('What is your name?');` 
    `return name;}`

- The last step of a function is actually calling a function in the code.
This runs the function with the defined value you give to the function i.e.

`let timeOfDay = gettimeofday(time);`

We are calling the function using the value of time.

## Benefits of using a Function

- Allows for better organization and cleaner code.
- You can use/call a function as many times as you want.
- Less coding in the long run if you wanted to use that JavaScript inside the function multiple times.
