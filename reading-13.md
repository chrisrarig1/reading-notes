# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

    - The occurrence of the personal computer in American homes increasing

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

    - There was a trend in marketing to promote computers to boys rather than girls. This in turn caused a lack of exposure to computers for girls at a early age. Also culture derived a narrative that geek culture was dominated by boys and this caused girls not feel comfortable to pursue experience with computers.
