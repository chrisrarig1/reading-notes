On this page I will be posting my reading notes as I progress through my eductaion at *Code Fellows*.

In this first lesson we talked about having a growth mindset and as a result I have developed my own definition:

-**Growth Mind Set** to me is having the ability to embrace change and challenges while open yourself up to interactions
with other learners.

This is something I have struggled with as my first reaction ~in the past~. I have learned to go through a checklist
to calm my reaction

1. Breathe..change is good
2. Remember challenges allow #growth#
3. People want to help
