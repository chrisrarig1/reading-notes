# Images and Information

## Images and CSS

### Sizing

- Using **CSS** you can control the size of your image using *width* and *height* (normally using pixels to size)
- It is wise to be consistent in sizing on your page

### Aligning

- **Float** is the most common way to align your image using **CSS**
- **align-left**, **align-right** and **align-center** are also another method used for aligning. This method aligns the image based on the format or the actual web page.

### Background Properties

- Using `background-image: url("")` allows you to place a image of your choosing to be the background of a certain element based on url.
- Using `background-repeat: repeat` makes the image repeat in any given axis direction of your choosing(x,y). It even allows you to have the image fixed or moving as the user scrolls.
- When an image is not being repeated it is possible to move that image to only a certain part of the page using `background-position: center center`. This allows you to place the image in any portion of the page based on positional terms.
