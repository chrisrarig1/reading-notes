# Intro to HTML and JavaScript

## HTML Structure

- HTML is split into two main components the **Head** and the **Body**
    - The **Head** contains all your info that is not visible on the page
    - The **Body** contains all the content of your page that you want the viewer to see
- HTML uses tags to differentiate parts of the code or pieces of your content.
    - `<p>`  This tag will contain your text or paragraph `</p>`
    - `<h1>` This tag will contain a header `</h1>`

## Developing a site

- *Wireframing* this is the rough patchwork of what you want your site to be. It should be hand-drawn and show similarities to how a newspaper is setup

## Using HTML

- In the example below we created a simple HTML script using the proper structure of a **HEAD** and **BODY**.

`<html>`
`<head>`
    `<title> HTML Learning </title>`
`</head>`
    `<body>`
        `<h1> This would be the title of your page </h1>`
        `<h2> This would be a subheading of your page or article </h2>`
    `</body>`
`</html>`

- As you can see above every tag `<>` has a closing tag `<>` this signals the end of that sections content.

## JavaScript

- *JavaScript*: This code allows your website to become interactive.
It basically dictates how your site behaves. It gives your site the pizazz that keeps things interesting.
- JavaScript is plugged into your HTML code to run. In code 102 we used this code to create if statements that generated paragraph content based on the time of day 

`if(time < 12){`
    `timeOfDay = 'Good Morning!!!';`
`} else if(time < 17){`
    `timeOfDay = 'Good Afternoon!!'; } `
