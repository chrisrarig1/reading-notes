## Pain and Suffering

- **Pain vs Suffering**
  - The price is *pain*, the pain is growth
  - This whole article in summation was to allow us to take into perspective the difference between *pain* and *suffering* to prepare us mentally for this class
  - One thing that must constantly be on our minds is the fact that we are growing while enduring the struggle of this class and that it will pay off in the end.

- **Consider these things during the pain**
   1. Whatâ€™s your perspective?
   2. Why are you doing this?
   3. Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
   4. Are you doing this for you?

## The Big "O"

- What is the **Big "O"**
  - It is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Specifically the worst-case scenario.

- **O(1)**
  - This describes an algorithm that will consistently execute in the same time regardless how large the input is

- **O(N)**
  - This describes a linear growth of algorithm in direct proportion to the amount of data inputed

- **O(N^2)**
  - Describes an algorithms performance directly proportional to the square of the size of the data set

- **O(2^N)**
  - Describes an algorithm whose growth doubles with the addition of more data

- **Logarithms**
  - Mathematical definition: a quantity representing the power to which  the base must be raised to produce a given number.



## Things I want to know more about

- I am interested on how we will implement the "Big O" information
