# What is GIT??

## Brief History of Git

- Developed From the Linux Kernel Project
- Tensions between the Linux Kernel Project and BitKeeper(A DVCS) led
    to the Chief Architect from Linux to develop *Git!!* 

## Git

- A *Distributed Version Control* that stores snapshots of versions
    of a file.
- Git allows local changes to be shared with a mass audience while
    tracking those changes and preventing data loss
- It is important to know **Terminal** (Mac) or Command Line(Windows)

## Defining Version Control

- It is basically a record keeping system that allows you to view 
    old work and even restore previous versions
- There are 3 different kinds of *Version Control*
    1. Local - control on your local device
    2. Centralized - One server share
    3. Distributed - Multiple repositories/tons of backup

## States

- In **Git** files can be in 3 states:committed, modified and staged
    1. Committed - Data/File is stored locally
    2. Modified - Data/File is changed but not committed to DB
    3. Staged - Changes are ready to be sent to DB

- There are 2 ways to get Git:
    1. [Git Website](http://git-scm.com/download/win) Follow the directions
    2. [GitHub](http://windows.github.com) Git comes as a part of this install

# Tips

Remember this process for changes :

- [ ] `git status` Allows you to see if changes have been made to a file
- [ ] `git add filename` Tracks the file with changes
- [ ] `git commit -m"statement of change"`
- [ ] `git push origin master` pushes changes to git
