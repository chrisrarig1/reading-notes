# Prepping My Mindset

## Deliberate Practice

- What is **Deliberate Practice**?
  - Focusing on the tough material rather than running through all the material. This will increase the effectiveness of those specific areas
- As a software developer it is important to continuously reach past your comfort zone when developing new projects
- Look for small uncomfortable things to learn rather than jumping into large projects

## Growth Mindset by Prof. Carol Dwek

- I thought this was a great TED talk by Carol Dwek. She made a great point on how people were raised to strive for an "A" in school rather than develop skills.
- Using the term "Not Yet" rather than "Failed" does have an impact on the overall reaction from someone who has not yet achieved their goals
- This had me wishing I was installed with a growth mindset at a young age rather than developing it so late in life.

## Grit by Angela Lee Duckworth

- What is Grit?
  - It is having passion and perseverance for longterm goals
  - Life is a marathon not a sprint
- This talk was great especially being in this program and seeing those I have worked with throughout this program show grit
- Growth Mindset develops Grit
- Failure is not a permanent state

## Philosophy of Success by Alain de Botton

- This was a great point of view on how you may be unintentionally judging someone based on their working status
- Defining Success
  - First you cannot be successful at everything
  - Your definition of success is not developed by yourself. We need to really pick at our current definitions to pry away the outside influences to get our true definition

## Emotional Intelligence

- I was not surprised by my scores here. I need to work on my **Social Awareness** an **Relationship Management**
- During my personal interactions I have always struggled when reading people and this is something I need to work on.
- My strengths based on some of the questions were not surprising

## Bias

- Strengths:
  - What is Bias
  - Connect to Mitigate Bias
- Weaknesses:
  - Empathy and Curiosity
  - Bias and Identity
- Focus:
  - I think it will be very important for me to focus on empathy especially with how stressful this class can be on everyone
