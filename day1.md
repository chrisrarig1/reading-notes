[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

*Markdown* is an easy to use text formating tool, which is very similar to microsoft word. It is especially useful for work documentation, but it uses can be fun as well.
Think making cool fonts and headers on a word documetn or even editing your old myspace page :older_adult:, but easier. Other than formatting direct text styles you can
also use markdown to create lists and tables.
- [x] Drink coffee
- [ ] Do homework
- [ ] Sleep
- [ ] Repeat

It also allows you to use ~strike through~ to either mark something off your list or bring attention to a word. Using these lists can be very beneficial to a work enviroment
or just a general reminder of things to do. Through this formatting language you even have the ability to bring something to some ones attention or mention them similiar to 
instagram @. It even supports emojis :bearded_person:.
