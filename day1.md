# [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

*Markdown* is an easy-to-use text formatting tool, which is very similar to Microsoft Word. It is especially useful for work documentation, but it uses can be fun as well.
Think making cool fonts and headers on a word document or even editing your old myspace page :older_adult:, but easier. Other than formatting direct text styles you can
also use markdown to create lists and tables.
- [x] Drink coffee
- [ ] Do homework
- [ ] Sleep
- [ ] Repeat

It also allows you to use ~strike-through~ to either mark something off your list or bring attention to a word. Using these lists can be very beneficial to a work environment
or just a general reminder of things to do. Through this formatting language, you even can bring something to someone's attention or mention them similar to *Instagram* @. 
It even supports emojis!!! :bearded_person:.
