## The Code I am still ashamed of

- I really liked this article and seeing the perspective of someone working with a company that causes a moral dilemma.
- One thing that really struck me was the idea that it is always necessary to think about the implications of your application even if it is something as small as the quiz the author wrote.
- At the end of the day I understand consulting is about completing the contract and the paycheck however implications such as this cannot be ignored.

## The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars

### Whom should the self-driving car save or harm when an accident is un-avoidable?

- This article was amazing. I had never thought about this situation until now. Very much like the kobayashi maru from Star Trek. It is a no-win situation.
- Germany's initial approach has been to minimize death and not to discriminate based on age, gender or any other factor. Human lives are also given priority over animals and property
- Does the passenger of the vehicle take priority over all?
- In a normal accident situation moral decisions such as these are made in a split second. Psychologically a person has a tendency for self preservation
- After reading this article I am glad I am not the one having to make this ethical decision
