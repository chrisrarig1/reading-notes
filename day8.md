# Learning Loops!!

- *Loops* are a sets of codes that allow for quick repeated operations until a condition is met.

## Types of Loops

1. **For Statements**
2. **Do while Statements**
3. **While Statements**
4. **Labeled Statements**
5. **Break Statements**
6. **Continue Statements**
7. **For in Statements**
8. **For of statements**

- Per class we will focus on *For* and *While* statements

## For Statements

- This loop continues to run until a certain condition declared in the code is proven false.

`for(let ii = 0; ii < 10; ii++){`
  `console.log("ii number " + ii);}`

- In the example above the statement will continue to run until `ii` is greater than or equal to 10.
- In this code we show 3 expressions
    1. Initial: `let ii = 0;` the initial number starts at zero
    2. Condition: `ii < 10;` the number must remain below 10
    3. Increment: `ii++` increases by 1 after each pass

## While Statements

- This loop runs as long as a condition set in the code remains true

`while (number < 10){`
  `console.log(number);`
  `number = number + 1;}`

- In the example above this code will run as long as the number is less than number. 

- In this code we show 2 expressions
    1. Condition: `(number < 10)` number must be less than 10 for this loop to continue
    2. Statement: `number = number + 1` the number will increase by 1 each run through.
