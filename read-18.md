# Encryption, Decryption, and Cracking

## Caesar Cipher

- Invented by Julius Caesar used to communicate with allies
- Simplicity makes it easy to learn
- Replaces letters by shifting the alphabet by a certain number

## Cracking the Cipher

- Three ways:
    1. Frequency Analysis
        - Analyzing how many times a certain letter and compare it to the popularity of letters in the English language
    2. Known Plaintext
        - If messages start in a similar pattern
    3. Brute Force
        - Forcing each possible shift of letters

## Encryption, Decryption, and Cracking

- Encryption: Scrambling Data according to a secret key
- Decryption: Recovering the original data from the scrambled data using a secret key
- Code cracking: Using clever techniques to uncover original data without key
